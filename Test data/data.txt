Occupational structure in a country depends on economic, technological and geographical factors and determines by specialization, level of per capita income, development of productive forces, and availability of natural resources. With the increase in the size of the population,, the demand for food, housing, health, education, nutrition, employment also increases. 
•	Demographic factors also impacts occupational structure of the country because as working population of a country increases, investment on Human resource development in terms of education, health, nutrition, employment etc increases.
•	When the primary resources are utilized on a commercial scale, it generates diversification of occupational structure and if agriculture remains at subsistence level, then diversification of occupations does not takes place. 
•	Where there is a shift of population from agriculture to industry a variety of jobs are being generated and the diversification process gets inputs from industrialization. 
•	Advancement in science and technology introduces specialization in occupational composition by creating highly specialized jobs.
•	All these developments together breed a new urban culture, which is more service oriented than past. It modifies the occupational structure (Chandna, 1986).
•	The occupational distribution of population of a region reveals the socio-economic characteristics of the people living in that particular region.
